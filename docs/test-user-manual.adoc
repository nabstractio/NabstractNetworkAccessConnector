= Magento Connector User Manual

== Introduction

Enable instant API connectivity with the Magento e-commerce platform
with the Magento Connector - making it simple to manage eCommerce
storefronts, shopping carts, and inventory.

This connector exposes common Magento APIs - such as those for
invoicing, stock management, product management, order tracking, graph
QL and more - making them easily accessible from within the Mule Flow.
Access to the Magento API allows businesses to integrate and automate
everyday business processes with other applications such as QuickBooks,
and Avalara.

With the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, businesses can do more with their
applications, safely and easily creating connectivity.
