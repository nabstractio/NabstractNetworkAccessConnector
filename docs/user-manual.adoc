= Nabstract Network Access Connectors User Manual

== Introduction 

The Nabstract Network Access Connectors provide various services to the Application developers and Users to interact with the connectivity networks like 5G systems, enabling them to monitor and manage the connectivity from the Application level. With these APIs, application developers can seamlessly access the Telco networks for fetching the information like status and location of devices, device connectivity details and quality of service of the traffic flows. They can also influence the policies in the network that can alter the behaviors of the connectivity to suit the application business logic.

MuleSoft maintains this connector under the https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/anypoint-connectors#connector-categories[MuleSoft Certified Category] support policy.


== Prerequisites  

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule 4, https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/cloud-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and https://docs.mulesoft.com/studio/latest/[Anypoint Studio]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing a https://docs.mulesoft.com/studio/latest/[Anypoint Studio] Tutorial. This page requires some basic knowledge of https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/[Mule Concepts], https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/mule-components[Components in a Mule Flow], and https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/[Global Elements].

== Installing the Connector

* You can install the connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange.]


== Maven Dependency Information
After downloading and installing the connector, following steps make the Nabstract Network Access Connector available inside a Mule application for use and to package the application with connector. If using Anypoint Studio, it will do this automatically. For Maven dependency management, include this XML snippet in pom.xml file in the Mule project.

       <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
            <artifactId>nabstract-network-access-connector</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
            <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
        </dependency>


== How to Configure

* After adding connector dependency to Mule project, click on *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
* In the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
* In the Choose Global Type wizard, collapse connector configuration and select *' Nabstract Network Access Connector'* and click OK.

[[ns-schema]]
== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Anypoint Studio, when you drag the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas, Studio automatically populates the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

*Namespace:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector+` +
*Schema Location:* `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-connector.xsd+`

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or another text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.
